Here are the answers to your questions regarding the Boeing 787 Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) system, based on available information and logical inference specific to the B787:

1. **The airplane is at the gate with an EFB fault. To see the EFB fault, you:**  
   To identify an EFB fault on the Boeing 787, you would typically check the EFB display itself or the Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS). When an EFB fault occurs, the system may display a "FAULT" flag in the header of the EFB screen. You can return to the MAIN MENU page on the EFB to determine which application generated the fault and access the System page for additional details about the issue. Additionally, EICAS may provide a crew alert message indicating an EFB-related fault, depending on the severity and system integration.

2. **The EFBs consist of the following components:**  
   On the Boeing 787, the EFB system is a Class 3 (installed) system, fully integrated into the aircraft's avionics. The EFB consists of:  
   - **Display Units**: Two dedicated EFB screens (one for the captain and one for the first officer), typically mounted on the flight deck.  
   - **Electronic Unit (EU)**: Each EFB has an associated electronic unit (e.g., Captain’s EFB EU and First Officer’s EFB EU) located in the forward electronic equipment bay, handling processing and data management.  
   - **Input Devices**: Cursor Control Devices (CCDs), multi-function keypads (MFKs), and potentially touch-screen capabilities depending on the configuration.  
   - **Data Connectivity**: Interfaces with the aircraft’s Common Data Network (CDN), flight deck printer, and other systems like the Flight Management System (FMS) or ACARS.  
   - **Mounting Hardware**: Fixed mounts ensuring positional integrity as part of the installed system.  

3. **What is meant by CCD?**  
   CCD stands for **Cursor Control Device**. On the Boeing 787, it is a flight deck input device, typically a trackball or joystick-like controller with buttons, located on the control stand (P10 panel) between the pilots. The CCD allows the crew to interact with the EFB and other flight deck displays (e.g., Multi-Function Displays or FMS) by moving a cursor, selecting options, and entering data.

4. **How would you select EFB from the CCD?**  
   To select the EFB using the CCD on the Boeing 787:  
   - Use the CCD to move the cursor on the associated display (e.g., the captain’s or first officer’s inboard or lower display).  
   - Navigate to the EFB application or icon on the screen (often accessible via a menu on the Multi-Function Display or directly on the EFB screen).  
   - Press the select button (typically part of the CCD) to activate the EFB interface.  
   The exact process may depend on the display configuration, but the CCD interfaces with the EFB system to allow menu navigation and selection.

5. **Selecting the L or R EFB is carried out by?**  
   Selecting the Left (L) or Right (R) EFB on the Boeing 787 is typically carried out by the respective pilot using their associated **Cursor Control Device (CCD)** or **Multi-Function Keypad (MFK)**. The captain uses the left CCD (on the left side of the control stand) to interact with the Left EFB, and the first officer uses the right CCD (on the right side) to interact with the Right EFB. The system is designed so each EFB is independently controlled by the pilot on that side, with the CCD or MFK providing direct access to the corresponding EFB display.

6. **What are the power requirements of the EFB components?**  
   The Boeing 787 EFB is a Class 3 installed system, meaning its power requirements are met through the aircraft’s electrical system rather than portable batteries. Specific power details include:  
   - **Voltage**: The EFB components are powered by the aircraft’s 28V DC or 115V AC buses, depending on the subsystem (e.g., the forward electronic equipment bay typically handles 115V AC and 28V DC conversions).  
   - **Source**: Power is supplied via the aircraft’s Common Computing Resource (CCR) cabinets and power distribution panels (e.g., P300, P400 in the forward E/E bay).  
   - **Redundancy**: The EFBs are tied to essential buses, ensuring operation during normal and backup power modes (e.g., battery or RAT mode), though non-essential functions may shed during load reduction scenarios like engine start with external power.  
   Exact wattage depends on the configuration, but the system is designed for continuous operation across all flight phases.

7. **When a selected function is not available on an EFB, what will be indicated?**  
   Cyan 

8. **To enter data on the EFB, which keyboards are used?**  
   On the Boeing 787, data entry on the EFB is facilitated by:  
   - **Multi-Function Keypad (MFK)**: A physical keypad integrated into the flight deck (e.g., part of the left or right CCR or control stand), allowing alphanumeric input.  
   - **Cursor Control Device (CCD)**: Used to select on-screen fields and interact with a virtual keyboard if the EFB software supports it.  
   - **Touch Screen (if equipped)**: Some EFB configurations may allow direct touch input, though this depends on the specific hardware version (e.g., Block Point Five upgrades).  
   The primary method is typically the MFK, supplemented by the CCD for navigation and selection, ensuring efficient data entry during flight operations.

These answers reflect the Boeing 787’s integrated EFB system design, leveraging its advanced avionics and flight deck layout.
