ATA 49
THE DE-PRIME VALVE OPENS DURING START AND SHUTDOWN TO DECREASE THE LOAD ON THE APU STARTER GENERATOR (ASG)

When the oil is cold, it is very thick. This increases the energy necessary to 
turn the APU during start. The APU oil pump de-prime valve opens to keep oil 
from the oil pump. The oil goes back to the oil pump inlet. The de-prime 
valve also opens during the APU shutdown. This helps the oil go back to the sump.

APU BATTERY & PMG
The fuel module gets electrical power from the APU hot battery bus during APU start. 
The fuel module gets electrical power from the permanent magnetic generator (PMG) after the APU starts.

The is no cool down period when the APU is shut down by the APU fire shutdown switch on the P40 panel

CAUTION - Do not remove the APUC and the inlet sensor module at the same time.
IF YOU REMOVE THE APUC AND INLET SENSOR MODULE AT THE SAME TIME, THE MAINTENANCE DATA IS LOST.

If the APU is running in the unattended mode and low oil pressure, high oil temp.
or high EGT condition is detected the APU does a protective shutdown. 
The EICAS caution message, APU LIMIT to show. 

Is it possible to pressurize the airplane with bleed air from the APU?
No, No load compressor 

What does the APU do? It supplies only electrical power for ground and air. 

What is the purpose of the APU inlet door switch? 
Inlet door position indication. 

What electrical system component selects the electrical power source during an APU start? 
Electrical power systemâ€™s BPCU. 

Why is it not possible to replace the APU lubrication and scavenge pumps? 
They are not LRU, they're part of the gearbox 

What is the purpose of the de-prime valve? 
Opens during cold start to allow air to go to the supply pump and opens at shut down to return oil to the gearbox area.

What controls the speed of the APU? 
The APUC through the dc motor driven in the fuel module

What supplies power to the fuel module during APU starting and running? The APUC until 60%

When does the APU shutdown from the P40 panel,? 
Immediately 

The APU operates in the attended mode when the airplane is:
in the air or on the ground with at least one engine running. 

It is not recommended that you replace the APU controller (APUC) while you replace the:
Inlet sensor module 

The APU is operating in the attended mode. APU low oil pressure or high EGT condition is detected. 
What are the indications? What do you do? 
EICAS message shows APU LIMITS and must be shut down manually.
