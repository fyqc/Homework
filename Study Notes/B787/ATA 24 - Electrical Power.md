### ATA 24 - Electrical Power

1. **What are the sources of power supply to the airplane?**  
   The 787’s power sources include:  
   - Four engine-driven generators (two per engine).  
   - An Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) generator.  
   - Main battery and APU battery.  
   - External power (ground power unit).  
   - Ram Air Turbine (RAT) for emergency power.

2. **What is the purpose of the main battery, battery diode?**  
   The main battery provides backup power for critical systems (e.g., flight controls, avionics) during power transitions or emergencies. The battery diode prevents reverse current flow from the aircraft’s electrical system back into the battery, ensuring safe charging and discharge operations.

3. **What is the purpose of the generator neutral relay?**  
   The generator neutral relay isolates the generator’s neutral point from the aircraft’s electrical system when the generator is offline, preventing unwanted current flow and ensuring proper load distribution when the generator is active.

4. **The airplane is on the ground. When does the battery supply power?**  
   The battery supplies power on the ground when external power and the APU are unavailable, such as during initial power-up, pre-flight checks, or if all other power sources fail. It powers essential systems like the flight control electronics and standby instruments.

5. **The Generator Control Unit (GCU) controls:**  
   The GCU controls the operation of each engine-driven generator, regulating voltage (typically 235V AC), frequency (variable, 360-800 Hz), and power output. It also provides overcurrent and fault protection, ensuring stable power delivery to the electrical buses.

6. **The Bus Power Control Unit (BPCU) controls?**  
   The BPCU manages the distribution of electrical power across the aircraft’s buses (e.g., AC and DC buses), coordinating power source selection (generators, APU, external power) and load shedding during faults or low-power conditions.

7. **How is the CBIC accessed?**  
   The Circuit Breaker Indication and Control (CBIC) system is accessed via the multifunction displays (MFDs) on the flight deck or the Maintenance Access Terminal (MAT), allowing crew or maintenance personnel to monitor and control electronic circuit breakers.

8. **What is the function of the Auto Transformer Rectifier Unit (ATRU)?**  
   The ATRU converts 235V AC power from the aircraft’s electrical system to 28V DC power to supply DC buses and components, such as avionics and battery charging systems.

9. **The common motor start controllers (CSMC) supply variable frequency and voltage for power and control of:**  
   The CSMCs supply variable frequency and voltage power to the engine starter motors during the start sequence, enabling electric starting of the engines without reliance on bleed air.

10. **What is the function of the SPU (Start Power Unit)?**  
   The Start Power Unit (SPU) provides high-voltage electrical power to the CSMCs for initiating engine starts, using energy from the APU or external power sources, enhancing the 787’s bleedless electrical architecture.
