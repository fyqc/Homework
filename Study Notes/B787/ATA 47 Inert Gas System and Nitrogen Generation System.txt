The air separation module (ASM) separates oxygen from the nitrogen generation system (NGS) 
compressed air to make the nitrogen enriched air (NEA) and oxygen enriched air (OEA).

The ground operation of the nitrogen generation system (NGS) is through the SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 
menu of the central maintenance computing function (CMCF).

How does the NGS decrease the oxygen content of the air in the fuel tank? 
Separates the oxygen from the air through air separator module.

What are the three main parts of the NGS? 
Motor Driven Compressor / Heat Exchanger / Air Separation Module

How do maintenance personnel operate the NGS (Nitrogen Generation System) on the ground?
