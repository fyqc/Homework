### ATA 34 - Navigation

1. **The weather radar receiver transmitter modules (RTM) are:**  
   The weather radar RTMs are solid-state units mounted in the nose of the aircraft, responsible for transmitting and receiving radar signals to detect weather patterns, turbulence, and precipitation.

2. **How is attitude information derived in the Integrated Standby Flight Display (ISFD)?**  
   The ISFD derives attitude information from its internal inertial sensors (gyroscopes and accelerometers), independent of the primary inertial reference units, providing a backup pitch and roll display.

3. **The Radio Altimeter transceivers obtain 28vdc power supply from?**  
   The Radio Altimeter transceivers receive 28V DC power from the aircraft’s DC electrical buses, specifically the critical standby bus, ensuring operation even during power interruptions.

4. **The Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) uses which system to convert the analog (audio) signal to data to be used by the Audio Control Panel (ACP)?**  
   The ADF uses the Common Core System (CCS) to digitize the analog audio signal, converting it into data transmitted over the aircraft’s fiber-optic network to the ACP.

5. **The Flight Management System calculates parameters to control the airplane for an optimum flight. What are the partitions involved?**  
   The FMS operates in partitions within the Common Computing Resource (CCR), including navigation, performance, and guidance partitions, which compute position, fuel efficiency, and autopilot commands.

6. **The Earth Reference System (ERS) provides Altitude, Heading, Velocity and Position by obtaining signals from the following:**  
   The ERS uses signals from the Inertial Reference Units (IRUs), GPS receivers, and air data sensors (pitot-static system) to provide accurate navigation data.

7. **The ERS has 2 Inertial Reference Units (IRU) and their secondary power supply is?**  
   The secondary power supply for the IRUs is the hot battery bus, ensuring continuous operation during power source transitions or failures.

8. **From where does the Integrated Flight Standby Display (IFSD) receive localizer and glideslope information?**  
   The IFSD receives localizer and glideslope information from the VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS) receivers, processed through dedicated standby navigation circuits.

9. **The ACE (Actuator Control Electronics) receives the Radio Altimeter Data from which bus?**  
   The ACE receives Radio Altimeter data from the ARINC 429 data bus, which connects it to the Radio Altimeter transceivers and other avionics systems.

10. **Where are the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) interrogators located?**  
   The DME interrogators are located in the electronics bay (E/E bay) beneath the flight deck, integrated with the navigation avionics suite.
