### ATA 35 - Oxygen

1. **The flight deck oxygen cylinders are made of:**  
   The flight deck oxygen cylinders are typically made of lightweight composite materials (e.g., carbon fiber wrapped around a metal liner) to reduce weight while maintaining high-pressure capacity (up to 1850 psi).

2. **During your walk around you see a yellow indication at the oxygen system overboard discharge port. What does this show?**  
   A yellow indication at the overboard discharge port shows that the oxygen system has been over-pressurized, and excess pressure has been vented. This could indicate a regulator malfunction or recent system activation.

3. **What kind of oxygen system is available for the cabin crew?**  
   The cabin crew uses portable oxygen cylinders with masks, providing a continuous flow of oxygen for mobility during emergencies, supplemented by fixed therapeutic oxygen outlets in some configurations.

4. **What kind of oxygen system is available to the passengers?**  
   Passengers are provided with a chemical oxygen generator system integrated into the Passenger Service Units (PSUs), which automatically deploys masks and generates oxygen for approximately 12-15 minutes during an emergency.

5. **The oxygen masks fall from the PSUs. When does the flow of oxygen start?**  
   Oxygen flow starts when a passenger pulls the mask downward, activating the chemical oxygen generator by triggering a firing pin that initiates the oxygen-producing reaction.

6. **How is oxygen from the portable oxygen cylinder dispensed?**  
   Oxygen from portable cylinders is dispensed through a regulator and mask assembly, controlled manually by turning a valve to provide a continuous or demand-based flow, depending on the unitâ€™s design.

7. **Why does the passenger oxygen mask not have a reservoir bag?**  
   The passenger oxygen mask lacks a reservoir bag because it uses a chemical oxygen generator, which provides a steady flow of oxygen directly to the mask for a fixed duration, eliminating the need for a bag found in continuous-flow systems.
